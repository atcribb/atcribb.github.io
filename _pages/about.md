👩‍💻 🪸 I am a palaeoecologist at the University of Southampton, primarily interested in applying quantitative palaeoecology approaches to conservation palaeobiology questions.

🌍 I am currently an independent 1851 Research Fellow working on a research programme that aims at understanding the impacts of ecosystem engineers on ecological and evolutionary dynamics during the Phaneroozic.

💡 I like applying new, creative approaches! At the moment, I am excited to be working on spatial analyses, Earth systems modelling, and ecological simulations.

👭 I am always keen to expand my research network and group at Southampton. If you would like to collaborate, or if you are a student interested working together, please reach out!
